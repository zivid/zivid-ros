## Installation

### Support

This driver supports Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04 with ROS2. Follow the official [ROS installation instructions](https://docs.ros.org/) for
your OS.

If you are looking for the Zivid ROS1 driver, please use the [`ros1-master` branch](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros/tree/ros1-master) for
Zivid SDK 2.13 or older, or use the [`ros1-sdk-2.14.0` branch](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros/tree/ros1-sdk-2.14.0) for Zivid SDK 2.14 or newer.

### Zivid SDK

To use the ROS driver you need to download and install the "Zivid Core" package. Zivid SDK version 2.15.0 is
supported. See [releases](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros/releases) for older ROS driver releases
that supports older SDK versions.

Follow [this guide][zivid-software-installation-url]
to install "Zivid Core" for your version of Ubuntu. The "Zivid Studio" and "Zivid Tools" packages can be useful
to test your system setup and camera, but are not required by the driver.

An OpenCL 1.2 compatible GPU with driver installed is required by the SDK. Follow
[this guide][install-opencl-drivers-ubuntu-url] to install OpenCL drivers for your system.

### C++ compiler

A C++17 compiler is required.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y g++
```

### Downloading and building Zivid ROS driver

First, source the `setup.bash` script for your ROS distribution in your terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
```

Then create the workspace and src directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
```

Clone the Zivid ROS project into the src directory:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros.git
```

Initialize rosdep:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
rosdep install -i --from-path ./ -y
```

Finally, build the driver:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## Getting started

Connect the Zivid camera to your PC. You can use the `ZividListCameras` command-line
tool available in the "Zivid Tools" package to confirm that your system has been configured correctly, and
that the camera is discovered by your PC. You can also open Zivid Studio and connect to the camera.
Close Zivid Studio before continuing with the rest of this guide.

Run the sample_capture_cpp via the launch script to check that everything is working.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws && source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample_with_rviz.launch sample:=sample_capture_cpp
```

This will start the `zivid_camera` driver node, the `sample_capture_cpp` node, and `rviz`.
The `zivid_camera` driver will connect to the first available Zivid camera, and 
then `sample_capture_cpp` will trigger captures repeatedly. The resulting point cloud and
color image should be visible in `rviz`.

A more detailed description of the `zivid_camera` driver follows below.

For sample code, see the [Samples](#samples) section.

## Launching the driver

To launch the driver, use `ros2 run`:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws && source install/setup.bash
ros2 run zivid_camera zivid_camera
```

The driver will by default connect to the first available Zivid camera.
This behavior can be overridden by setting the `serial_number` launch parameter, see below.

### Launch Parameters (advanced)

The following parameters can be specified when starting the driver. Note that all the parameters are
optional.

For example, to run the zivid_camera driver with a specific `serial_number` specified:

```bash
ros2 run zivid_camera zivid_camera --ros-args -p serial_number:=ABCD1234
```

Or you can use a [launch file](#launch-files) and invoke it as:

```bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples zivid_camera.launch serial_number:=ABCD1234
```

`file_camera_path` (string, default: "")
> Specify the path to a file camera to use instead of a real Zivid camera. This can be used to
> develop without access to hardware. The file camera returns the same point cloud for every capture.
> [Visit our knowledgebase to download file camera.](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/file-camera.html)

`frame_id` (string, default: "zivid_optical_frame")
> Specify the frame_id used for all published images and point clouds.

`serial_number` (string, default: "")
> Specify the serial number of the Zivid camera to use.  This parameter is optional. By default, the
> driver will connect to the first available camera.

`update_firmware_automatically` (bool, default: true)
> Specify if the firmware of the connected camera should be automatically updated to the correct
> version when the Zivid ROS driver starts. If set to false, if the firmware version is out of date
> then camera must be manually updated, for example using Zivid Studio or `ZividFirmwareUpdater`.
> Read more about [firmware update in our knowledgebase][firmware-update-kb-url].
> This parameter is optional, and by default it is true.

`color_space` (string, default: "linear_rgb")
> Specify the color space to use when publishing point clouds and images. Valid values:
>
>  - `srgb`: Publish in the sRGB color space. The sRGB color space is suitable for showing an image
>    on a display for human viewing. It is easier to see details in darker areas of an image in sRGB
>    than in linear RGB, as more of the dynamic range is dedicated to darker colors. This format is
>    assumed by default by most monitors and should be used when displaying an image. This option
>    should be used to match colors to the visualization in Zivid Studio.
>  - `linear_rgb`: Publish in linear RGB color space. Linear RGB is suitable as input to computer
>    vision algorithms.
>
> In particular, this parameter affects the data published over the [color/image_color](#colorimage_color) and
> [points/xyzrgba](#pointsxyzrgba) topics. Please see the Zivid knowledge base on
> [2D Color Spaces and Output Formats](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/reference-articles/color-spaces-and-output-formats.html)
> for more details.

## Configuration

The capture settings used by the `zivid_camera` ROS driver must be configured using YAML,
which can be exported from Zivid Studio or the API, or downloaded as .yml files from our [knowledge
base][presets-kb-url].

For convenience, the Zivid ROS driver supports configuring capture settings in two ways: Using file path
to a .yml file, or as a YAML string.

The following ROS parameters control which settings are used when capturing with the driver. Note
that you must set _either_ the `_file_path` or the `_yaml` parameter. If both `_file_path` and `_yaml`
parameters are set to a non-empty string at the same time, then the driver will return an error when
capturing. By default, all settings parameters are empty.

### 3D capture

`settings_file_path` (string, default: "")
> Specify the path to a .yml file that contains the settings you want to use.

`settings_yaml` (string, default: "")
> Specify a YAML string that contains the settings you want to use. For example, you can copy the contents of a .yml
> file saved from Zivid Studio.

The service `capture_assistant/suggest_settings` will modify the settings parameters automatically.

### 2D capture

`settings_2d_file_path` (string, default: "")
> Specify the path to a .yml file that contains the settings you want to use.

`settings_2d_yaml` (string, default: "")
> Specify a YAML string that contains the 2D settings you want to use. For example, you can copy the contents of a 
> .yml file saved from Zivid Studio.

## Services

### capture
[std_srvs/srv/Trigger](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.html)

Invoke this service to trigger a 3D capture. See section [Configuration](#configuration) for how to
configure the 3D capture settings. The resulting point cloud is published on topics [points/xyz](#pointsxyz) and
[points/xyzrgba](#pointsxyzrgba), color image is published on topic [color/image_color](#colorimage_color),
and depth image is published on topic [depth/image](#depthimage). Camera calibration is published on
topics [color/camera_info](#colorcamera_info) and [depth/camera_info](#depthcamera_info).

See [Sample Capture](#sample-capture) for code example.

### capture_2d
[std_srvs/srv/Trigger](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.html)

Invoke this service to trigger a 2D capture. See section [Configuration](#configuration) for how to
configure the 2D capture settings. The resulting 2D image is published to topic
[color/image_color](#colorimage_color). Note: 2D RGB image is also published as a part of 3D
capture, see [capture](#capture).

See [Sample Capture 2D](#sample-capture-2d) for code example.

### capture_and_detect_calibration_board
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndDetectCalibrationBoard.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndDetectCalibrationBoard.srv)

Performs a capture to detect a calibration board and estimate its pose. This service call will perform a relatively slow
but high-quality point cloud capture with the connected camera. Any settings applied to the camera in the ROS driver
will be ignored for calls to this service, appropriate settings are automatically used. The resulting point cloud and
color image will be published just like during a normal call to the [capture](#capture) service.

The returned data from the service includes a member of the type
[DetectionResultCalibrationBoard.msg](./zivid_interfaces/msg/DetectionResultCalibrationBoard.msg), with details on any
detected calibration board.

The functionality is to be exclusively used in combination with Zivid verified calibration boards. For further
information please visit [Zivid help page](https://support.zivid.com).

### capture_and_detect_markers
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndDetectMarkers.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndDetectMarkers.srv)

Performs a capture to detect fiducial markers, such as ArUco markers, and estimate their poses. As opposed to the
[capture_and_detect_calibration_board](#capture_and_detect_calibration_board) service, this service uses the current
settings applied to the camera. See section [Configuration](#configuration) for how to configure the 3D capture
settings. The resulting point cloud and color image will be published just like during a normal call to the
[capture](#capture) service.

The name of the fiducial dictionary must be provided, along with a list of marker IDs. The scene may not need not
contain all listed markers for a successful detection. For further information on fiducial markers see [this wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker). For more information on ArUco markers specifically, refer to the
[OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html).

The returned data from the service includes a member of the type
[DetectionResultFiducialMarkers.msg](./zivid_interfaces/msg/DetectionResultFiducialMarkers.msg), with details on any
detected fiducial markers.

### capture_and_save
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndSave.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAndSave.srv)

It does exactly the same as the [capture](#capture) service, in addition it will save the frame to
a file. This service takes a path as an argument. The chosen format is detected via the file extension.
See [knowledge base](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/reference-articles/point-cloud-structure-and-output-formats.html#zivid-output-formats)
for a list of available output formats.

See [Sample Capture and Save](#sample-capture-and-save) for code example.

### capture_assistant/suggest_settings
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAssistantSuggestSettings.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CaptureAssistantSuggestSettings.srv)

Invoke this service to analyze your scene and find suggested settings for your particular scene,
camera distance, ambient lighting conditions, etc. This service will automatically update the node parameter
`settings_yaml` with the suggested settings, see section [Configuration](#configuration).
When this service has returned, you can invoke the [capture](#capture) service to trigger a 3D capture using
these suggested settings.

This service has two parameters:

`max_capture_time` (duration):
> Specify the maximum capture time for the settings suggested by the Capture Assistant. A longer
> capture time may be required to get good data for more challenging scenes. Minimum value is
> 0.2 sec and maximum value is 10.0 sec.

`ambient_light_frequency` (uint8):
> Possible values are: `AMBIENT_LIGHT_FREQUENCY_NONE`, `AMBIENT_LIGHT_FREQUENCY_50HZ`,
> `AMBIENT_LIGHT_FREQUENCY_60HZ`. Can be used to ensure that the suggested settings are compatible
> with the frequency of the ambient light in the scene. If ambient light is unproblematic, use
> `AMBIENT_LIGHT_FREQUENCY_NONE` for optimal performance. Default is `AMBIENT_LIGHT_FREQUENCY_NONE`.

See [Sample Capture Assistant](#sample-capture-assistant) for code example.

### camera_info/model_name
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CameraInfoModelName.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CameraInfoModelName.srv)

Returns the camera's model name.

### camera_info/serial_number
[zivid_interfaces/srv/CameraInfoSerialNumber.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/CameraInfoSerialNumber.srv)

Returns the camera's serial number.

### is_connected
[zivid_interfaces/srv/IsConnected.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/IsConnected.srv)

Returns if the camera is currently in `Connected` state (from the perspective of the ROS driver).
The connection status is updated by the driver every 10 seconds and before each [capture](#capture)
service call. If the camera is not in `Connected` state the driver will attempt to re-connect to
the camera when it detects that the camera is available. This can happen if the camera is
power-cycled or the USB/Ethernet cable is unplugged and then replugged.

### hand_eye_calibration/start
[zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationStart.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationStart.srv)

Prepares the node for hand-eye calibration and clears any previously collected hand-eye captures. The type of the
[calibration object](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/calibration-object.html) to be
used during capture must be provided. A *working directory* can optionally be provided so that all captures are saved to
this directory. If provided, the directory must be given as an absolute path and the directory must be empty.

This service must be called first before capturing data for hand-eye calibration. It can also be used to restart an
active hand-eye calibration session. After calling this service, proceed with captures by calling the
[hand_eye_calibration/capture](#hand_eye_calibrationcapture) service.

Please refer to the Zivid knowledge base for more information on [hand-eye
calibration](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye.html).

### hand_eye_calibration/capture
[zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationCapture.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationCapture.srv)

Performs a hand-eye calibration capture. This service takes the robot pose as an input. Then it performs a capture, and
detects any calibration objects. The resulting point cloud and color image will be published just like during a normal call to the
[capture](#capture) service.

If the detections is successful, the result is stored locally in the driver. Additionally, if a working directory was
specified during start, the captured frame and robot pose is saved to that directory.

This service uses the currently stored 3D capture settings to perform the capture. Ensure that the camera is [properly
configured](#configuration) first. Please see the knowledge base for [how to get good quality data](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/how-to-get-good-quality-data-on-zivid-calibration-board.html).

The camera and robot should be appropriately positioned so that the calibration object is visible in the frame. Multiple
captures in different poses are necessary. After performing several captures, one can proceed by calling the
[hand_eye_calibration/calibrate](#hand_eye_calibrationcalibrate) service.

### hand_eye_calibration/calibrate
[zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationCalibrate.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationCalibrate.srv)

Computes the hand-eye calibration transform based on the captures gathered during the current hand-eye calibration
session. Both eye-to-hand and eye-in-hand configurations are supported. If successful, the computed hand-eye transform
is returned, see the knowledge base for more information on the [hand-eye calibration
solution](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/hand-eye-calibration-solution.html).

The calibration procedure requires all robot poses to be different. At least 2 poses are required when using a
calibration board, or 6 poses when using fiducial markers. For fiducial markers, each marker must be detected across 2
poses at minimum.

Low degrees-of-freedom (DOF) calibration is also supported (experimental) by supplying the fixed placement of
calibration objects. This is not needed for regular (6-DOF) calibration.

### hand_eye_calibration/load
[zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationLoad.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/HandEyeCalibrationLoad.srv)

Loads a working directory from a previous hand-eye calibration session. See the
[hand_eye_calibration/start](#hand_eye_calibrationstart) service for how to start a session with a working directory.
The captures and robot poses are loaded from the provided directory. The directory is opened as read-only, and no new
captures can be made during this session. However, calls to the
[hand_eye_calibration/calibrate](#hand_eye_calibrationcalibrate) service can be made to compute the hand-eye transform
from the loaded data.

### infield_correction/read
[zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionRead.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionRead.srv)

Returns the state of the [infield
correction](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/infield-correction.html) of the camera.

### infield_correction/reset
[std_srvs/srv/Trigger](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.html)

Resets the infield correction on the camera to factory settings.

### infield_correction/start
[std_srvs/srv/Trigger](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.html)

Prepares for infield correction, and clears any infield correction captures gathered so far in the `zivid_camera` node.

This service must be called before gathering captures using the [infield_correction/capture](#infield_correctioncapture)
service. However, other infield correction services can be used without calling the start service first. This service
can also be used to restart an active infield correction session.

Please refer to the Zivid knowledge base for further information and guidelines for [infield
correction](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/infield-correction.html). 

### infield_correction/capture
[zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCapture.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCapture.srv)

Takes a capture to be used for infield correction. Please point the camera at a Zivid infield calibration object. It is
recommended to cover several distances, with one or more captures at each distance. Successful captures are stored in
the `zivid_camera` node.

Before calling this service, a call to [infield_correction/start](#infield_correctionstart) must have been made first.

This service call will perform a relatively slow but high-quality point cloud capture with the connected camera. Any
settings applied to the camera in the ROS driver will be ignored for calls to this service, appropriate settings are
automatically used. The resulting point cloud and color image will be published just like during a normal call to the
[capture](#capture) service.

After sufficient number of captures, proceed by calling the [infield_correction/compute](#infield_correctioncompute)
service to compute the verification metrics and the correction based on the captures gathered so far. To additionally
write the correction to camera, proceed by calling the
[infield_correction/compute_and_write](#infield_correctioncompute_and_write) service.

The captured data is cleared if the node is stopped, or after a successful call to either of the services
[infield_correction/start](#infield_correctionstart) or
[infield_correction/compute_and_write](#infield_correctioncompute_and_write).

### infield_correction/compute
[zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCompute.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCompute.srv)

Calculates the new infield correction based the captured data gathered so far through the service
[infield_correction/capture](#infield_correctioncapture).

The quantity and range of data is up to the user, but generally a larger dataset will yield a more accurate and reliable
correction. If all measurements are taken at approximately the same distance, the resulting correction will mainly be
valid at those distances. If several measurements are taken at significantly different distances, the resulting
correction will likely be more suitable for extrapolation to distances beyond where the dataset is collected.

This service also acts as verification of the quality of the infield correction on a camera, or the need for one if none
exists already. It returns an indication of the dimension trueness at the location where the input data was captured.

If the returned assessment indicates a trueness error that is above the threshold for your application, consider using
[infield_correction/compute_and_write](#infield_correctioncompute_and_write). The service also returns information
regarding the proposed working range and the accuracy that can be expected within the working range, if the correction
is later written to the camera.

### infield_correction/compute_and_write
[zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCompute.srv](./zivid_interfaces/srv/InfieldCorrectionCompute.srv)

Calculates the new infield correction based the captured data gathered so far through the service
[infield_correction/capture](#infield_correctioncapture), and writes the result to the camera.

If the write operation is successful, the infield correction capture data is cleared. To perform infield correction
again, a new session must be started with a call to the [infield_correction/start](#infield_correctionstart) service.

Please see the [infield_correction/compute](#infield_correctioncompute) service for more information on the computed
correction.

### infield_correction/remove_last_capture
[std_srvs/srv/Trigger](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.html)

Removes the last infield correction capture gathered in the `zivid_camera` node.

## Topics

The Zivid ROS driver provides several topics providing 3D, color, SNR and camera calibration
data as a result of calling capture/capture_2d services. The different output topics provides 
flexibility for different use cases. Note that for performance reasons no messages are generated
or sent on topics with zero active subscribers.

### color/camera_info
[sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo.html)

Camera calibration and metadata.

### color/image_color
[sensor_msgs/msg/Image](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.html)

Color/RGBA image. RGBA image is published as a result of invoking the [capture](#capture) or
[capture_2d](#capture_2d) service. Images are encoded as "rgba8", where the alpha channel
is always 255.

### depth/camera_info
[sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo.html)

Camera calibration and metadata.

### depth/image
[sensor_msgs/msg/Image](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.html)

Depth image. Each pixel contains the z-value (along the camera Z axis) in meters.
The image is encoded as 32-bit float. Pixels where z-value is missing are NaN.

### points/xyzrgba
[sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.html)

Point cloud data. Sent as a result of the [capture](#capture) service. The output is
in the camera's optical frame, where x is right, y is down and z is forward.
The included point fields are x, y, z (in meters) and rgba (color).

### points/xyz
[sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.html)

Point cloud data. This topic is similar to topic [points/xyzrgba](#pointsxyzrgba), except
that only the XYZ 3D coordinates are included. This topic is recommended if you don't need
the RGBA values.

### snr/camera_info
[sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo.html)

Camera calibration and metadata.

### snr/image
[sensor_msgs/msg/Image](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.html)

Each pixel contains the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) value. The image is encoded as 32-bit
float. Published as a part of the [capture](#capture) service.

### normals/xyz
[sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.html)

Normals for the point cloud. The included fields are normal x, y and z coordinates.
Each coordinate is a float value. There are no additional padding floats, so point-step is
12 bytes (3*4 bytes). The normals are unit vectors. Note that subscribing to this topic
will cause some additional processing time for calculating the normals.

## Samples

In the `zivid_samples` package we have added samples that demonstrate how to use
the Zivid ROS driver. These samples can be used as a starting point for your project.

To launch the Python samples using `ros2 launch`, you need `python` to be available as a command.
For example, the `python-is-python3` package can be installed to achieve this, by running the
following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python-is-python3
```

On Windows, the Python samples cannot be launched using `ros2 launch`. Instead, please launch the
samples using `ros2 run zivid_samples <sample_name>.py` together with
`ros2 run zivid_camera zivid_camera` in another terminal window.

### Sample Infield Correction

This sample shows how to invoke the various [infield_correction/[...]](#infield_correctionread) services to perform infield correction on Zivid cameras.

Source code: [C++](./zivid_samples/src/sample_infield_correction.cpp) [Python](./zivid_samples/scripts/sample_infield_correction.py)

```bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_infield_correction_cpp operation:=<operation>
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_infield_correction.py operation:=<operation>
```
Using ros2 run (when `zivid_camera` node is already running):
```bash
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_infield_correction_cpp --ros-args -p operation:=<operation>
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_infield_correction.py --ros-args -p operation:=<operation>
```

With the following argument:

`operation` (string, required)
> Specify the infield correction operation to perform, one of: 
>   - `verify`: Verify camera correction quality based on a single capture using the [`infield_correction/start`](#infield_correctionstart), [`infield_correction/capture`](#infield_correctioncapture), and [`infield_correction/compute`](#infield_correctioncompute) services.
>   - `correct`: Calculate in-field correction based on a series of captures at different distances. Demonstrates the use of [`infield_correction/start`](#infield_correctionstart), [`infield_correction/capture`](#infield_correctioncapture), and [`infield_correction/compute`](#infield_correctioncompute) services. Begins by preparing the camera node for infield correction captures, then the sample gathers a fixed number of captures at a fixed duration between captures. The correction result is computed after every capture.
>   - `correct_and_write`: Same as `correct`, but additionally writes the correction results to the camera. Demonstrates the [`infield_correction/compute_and_write`](#infield_correctioncompute_and_write) service.
>   - `read`: Get information about the correction currently on the connected camera using the [`infield_correction/read`](#infield_correctionread) service.
>   - `reset`: Reset correction on connected camera to factory settings using the [`infield_correction/reset`](#infield_correctionreset) service.

Please see the [infield correction documentation](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/infield-correction.html) for prerequisites and guidelines on how to perform the correction.

For a more interactive experience, we recommend using the [infield correction panel](#infield-correction-panel) from the Zivid RViz plugin.

The typical procedure for performing a new infield correction is:

1. `start`: Prepare for infield correction, clears any existing infield correction captures.
2. `capture`: Take multiple captures from different angles and distances in accordance with the typical operating conditions of the camera.
3. `compute`: Check the computed correction results and the estimated errors, verify that they give satisfactory results.
4. `compute_and_write`: Compute the correction and write the results to camera.

The `zivid_camera` node persists the infield correction dataset as long as it is running. To start the infield correction captures over again, use the `start` operation which clears all infield correction captures previously gathered. The `remove_last_capture` can be used to remove just the last capture.

### Sample Hand-Eye Calibration

This sample shows how to invoke various [hand_eye_calibration/[...]](#hand_eye_calibrationstart) services to perform
hand-eye calibration on Zivid cameras. The sample is for exposition only, to demonstrate how the services can be called.

The sample begins by preparing the camera node for hand-eye calibration. Then a fixed number of captures is gathered at
a fixed duration between captures, using a simulated robot pose. Finally, hand-eye calibration is run using the gathered
data.

Source code: [C++](./zivid_samples/src/sample_hand_eye_calibration.cpp) [Python](./zivid_samples/scripts/sample_hand_eye_calibration.py)

```bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_hand_eye_calibration_cpp configuration:=<configuration> marker_ids:=<marker_ids> working_directory:=<working_directory>
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_hand_eye_calibration.py configuration:=<configuration> marker_ids:=<marker_ids> working_directory:=<working_directory>
```

Using ros2 run (when `zivid_camera` node is already running):
```bash
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_hand_eye_calibration_cpp --ros-args -p configuration:=<configuration> -p marker_ids:=<marker_ids> -p working_directory:=<working_directory>
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_hand_eye_calibration.py --ros-args -p configuration:=<configuration> -p marker_ids:=<marker_ids> -p working_directory:=<working_directory>
```

With the following arguments:

`configuration` (string, required)
> Specify the configuration for the hand-eye calibration, one of:
>   - `eye_to_hand`: Performs calibration in the [eye-to-hand configuration](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/hand-eye-calibration-problem.html#eye-to-hand).
>   - `eye_in_hand`: Performs calibration in the [eye-in-hand configuration](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/hand-eye-calibration-problem.html#eye-in-hand).

`marker_ids` (dynamic array of integers, default: *empty*):
> Specifies a list of [fiducial marker IDs](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/calibration-object.html) used for detection (e.g. `[1,2,3]`),
> or empty if a [Zivid calibration board](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye/calibration-object.html) is used instead.

`working_directory` (string, default: *empty*)
> argument specifies the [working directory](#hand_eye_calibrationstart) used to store the
> gathered data, or empty to indicate that the data should not be stored on disk.
> A non-empty value must specify an absolute path to an empty directory.

For more information on performing the calibration, please see the [Zivid hand-eye calibration documentation](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye.html).

### Sample with SDK: Hand-Eye Calibration

This sample shows how to perform [hand-eye calibration](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/applications/hand-eye.html)
using the Zivid SDK. The sample serves to demonstrate how to use the Zivid SDK on the sample side directly, as a
supplement to the services provided by the Zivid camera driver.

Captures are performed using service calls to the Zivid camera node and stored to disk, while the hand-eye calibration
itself is performed locally using the stored captures. The hand-eye calibration services are not used in this sample.
The sample expects files saved on the camera node to be directly accessible from the sample node.

This sample expects the `zivid_camera` to run in a separate node, in a different process. When using the Zivid API, each
process needs to have its own copy of `Zivid::Application`, which also applies when invoking the hand-eye calibration
procedures. For this reason, the hand-eye sample constructs its own copy of `Zivid::Application`.

```bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_with_sdk_hand_eye_calibration_cpp configuration:=eye_to_hand
```

Or using ros2 run (when `zivid_camera` node is already running):

```bash
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_capture_and_save_cpp --ros-args -p configuration:=eye_to_hand
```

***Instructions:***

After the sample has been initialized with the above commands, proceed as follows.

1. Repeat the following for a desired number of captures, e.g. 10-20:
    1. Position the robot with a suitable pose for the calibration object.
    2. Ensure that the pose of the robot end-effector is reflected by the
       [tf2](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/Tf2/Introduction-To-Tf2.html) frame
       `robot_end_effector` (customizable) with a valid transform from the world frame `map` (customizable).
    3. Call the `/hand_eye_capture` service with a Trigger request to initiate a capture with the current robot pose.
2. Call the `/hand_eye_calibrate` service with a Trigger request to perform the calibration using all the previous
   captures.

Source code: [C++](./zivid_samples/src/sample_hand_eye_calibration.cpp)

The sample is initialized with up to four ROS parameters:
- `configuration`: Either `eye_to_hand` or `eye_in_hand`.
- `aruco_ids` [optional]: Specifies an integer list of Aruco marker IDs, leave empty to specify
  that a calibration board is used instead.
- `robot_frame_id` [optional]: The name of the tf2 frame that the robot pose (the robot end-effector
  transformation) will be read from. Default: `robot_end_effector`.
- `world_frame_id` [optional]: The name of the fixed tf2 world frame. Default: `map`.

To launch with all parameters specified:

```bash
ros2 launch zivid_samples sample.launch sample:=sample_hand_eye_calibration_cpp configuration:=eye_to_hand aruco_ids:=[1,2,3] robot_frame_id:=tool0 world_frame_id:=world
```

The sample node exposes two services that should be used during calibration:

- `/hand_eye_sample_with_sdk_capture`: Reads the current robot pose, sends a `capture_and_save` request to the
  `zivid_camera` node, loads the same capture from file, and detects the calibration object. Responds with success if
  the calibration object was detected.
- `/hand_eye_sample_with_sdk_calibrate`: Performs the hand-eye calibration using the previous successful captures.
  Responds with success and the calibration result if the calibration succeeded.

All captures and poses are saved to a temporary folder listed in the logged output. The folder structure is compatible
with the Zivid CLI tool `ZividExperimentalHandEyeCalibration`.

Example service calls using the command line:
```bash
ros2 service call /hand_eye_capture std_srvs/srv/Trigger
ros2 service call /hand_eye_calibrate std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

Example for setting a static robot end effector frame (for testing):
```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --x 1 --y 2 --z 3 --yaw 1.57 --pitch 0 --roll 0 --frame-id map --child-frame-id robot_end_effector
```

Note that the robot pose and associated transform should be changed between each capture.

### Sample with SDK: Hand-eye Calibration Component

Running the zivid camera node and hand-eye calibration component together in a single process.

Terminal 1:
```bash
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container_mt
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher --x 1 --y 2 --z 3 --yaw 1.57 --pitch 0 --roll 0 --frame-id map --child-frame-id robot_end_effector
```

Terminal 3:
```bash
# Load camera
ros2 component load /ComponentManager zivid_camera zivid_camera::ZividCamera

# Just to set the settings parameter
ros2 run zivid_samples sample_capture_and_save_cpp

# Load and start the hand-eye node
ros2 component load /ComponentManager zivid_samples zivid_component::HandEyeCalibration -p configuration:=eye_in_hand
ros2 service call /hand_eye_sample_with_sdk_capture std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

## RViz Plugin

### Infield Correction Panel

The Zivid RViz plugin provides a panel to interactively perform infield correction with a Zivid camera.

To see the panel in RViz, go to `Panels -> Add New Panel`, then select `Zivid Infield Correction` and click `OK`.
Infield correction can now be performed by interacting with the newly added panel.

The panel is also visible when [launching](#launch-zivid-camera-with-rviz) the Zivid camera node with RViz, e.g.:
```
ros2 launch zivid_samples zivid_camera_with_rviz.launch
```

Please see the [infield correction documentation](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/infield-correction.html)
for prerequisites and guidelines on how to perform the correction.

## URDF

The Zivid description package provides a [Unified Robotics Description Format
(URDF)](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/URDF/URDF-Main.html) for Zivid cameras. Visual and
collision models are provided for the Zivid cameras, and a visual model of their field-of-view (FOV) can optionally be
included. The description specifies the coordinate frame of the point cloud (`zivid_optical_frame` by default) in
relation to the base of the camera (`zivid_base_link` by default).

The position and orientation of the optical frame are different between camera models, as well as their FOV. To model
these differences, the description is specified in a [Xacro
macro](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/URDF/Using-Xacro-to-Clean-Up-a-URDF-File.html) which is used
to generate the URDF. Ensure that the appropriate [camera model](#available-models) is provided. This is particularly
important when visualizing the FOV, as that has large variations between models.

The provided relation between the Zivid optical frame and base link is based on uncalibrated values, expect certain
real-world differences. [Hand-eye calibration](#sample-hand-eye-calibration) should be performed for accurate placement
of the point cloud in a target coordinate frame.

### Usage

The URDF or the underlying macro can be included in your own project.

To view the Zivid 2, Zivid 2+, or Zivid 2+R cameras in RViz:
```

```

Visit our  [knowledgebase](https://support.zivid.com/en/latest/academy/camera/file-camera.html) to download file camera.

### How to use multiple Zivid cameras

You can use multiple Zivid cameras simultaneously by starting one node per camera and specifying
unique namespaces per node.

```bash
ros2 run zivid_camera zivid_camera --ros-args --remap __ns:=/zivid_camera1
```

```bash
ros2 run zivid_camera zivid_camera --ros-args --remap __ns:=/zivid_camera2
```

You can combine this with a serial_number parameter (see above) to  control which node uses which camera.
By default, the zivid_camera node will connect to the first available (unused) camera. We recommend that
you first start the first node, then wait for it to be ready (for example, by waiting for the [capture](#capture)
service to be available), and then start the second node. This avoids any race conditions where both nodes
may try to connect to the same camera at the same time.

### How to run the unit and module tests

This project comes with a set of unit and module tests to verify the provided functionality. To run
the tests locally, first download and install the required data used for testing:
```bash
for sample in "FileCameraZivid2M70.zip" "BinWithCalibrationBoard.zip"; do
